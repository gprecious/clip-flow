# Landing Page Creator

Build persuasive landing pages that convert visitors into customers using the Problem → Solution → Proof → Action framework.

## Core Framework: 3 Questions Every Visitor Asks

Every high-converting landing page must answer:

1. **What problem does this solve?** - Name the pain, promise relief
2. **How does it work?** - Show concrete steps/features
3. **Is this for someone like me?** - Provide relatable social proof

## Page Structure

| Section | Purpose | Key Element |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Hero | Hook with pain + promise | Headline < 10 words |
| Features/How-It-Works | Show solution | 3-4 numbered steps |
| Social Proof | Build trust | Testimonials + logos |
| CTA | Convert | Action button + objection removal |

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Requirements

Ask the user:
- What product/service is this for?
- Who is the target audience?
- What is the main pain point being solved?
- What action should visitors take? (signup, purchase, demo, etc.)

### 2. Create Content Structure

**Hero Section:**
```
Headline: [Pain point → Benefit] (under 10 words)
Subheadline: Expand on the promise
CTA Button: Action verb (Start, Get, Try, Join)
```

**Features Section:**
```
Step 1: [First value point]
Step 2: [Second value point]
Step 3: [Third value point]
```

**Social Proof Section:**
```
- 2-3 testimonials with names/photos
- Client logos or user count
- Specific, quantifiable results
```

**Final CTA Section:**
```
- Repeat value proposition
- Remove objections ("No credit card", "Free trial")
- Bold, unmissable button
```

### 3. Build the Page

Use React + Tailwind CSS. Follow these principles:

- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **Clear visual hierarchy** - one CTA per section maximum
- **Generous whitespace** - let content breathe
- **Fast load times** - optimize images, minimal dependencies

## Persuasion Techniques

**Pain-first messaging:** Lead with specific pain points, not abstract features.
- Good: "Stop losing customers to slow checkout"
- Bad: "Next-generation checkout solutions"

**Social proof placement:** Show testimonials from people similar to the target audience.

**Objection handling:** Address concerns near CTAs (pricing, risk, time commitment).

**Urgency/scarcity:** Use sparingly and authentically (limited spots, launch pricing).
